    "At compile time this causes the body of the function to be copied or `inlined` directly into the body of the calling function for the final binary. This removes overhead associated with function calls jumping to a new point in code. Normally the compiler will do this automatically where it improves performance, but this decorator forces it to occur, the downside is that it can increase the binary size for the duplicated functions.\n",
