# Intro to Mojo
_This guide is in the early stages, feedback welcomed [on Github](https://github.com/mojodojodev/mojodojo.dev/discussions/categories/feedback)_

This guide assumes some familiarity with a programming language like Python, but does not assume knowledge about Computer Science (CS). Anything that explains a `CS Fundamental` will be in a green box so you can skip over them if you already come from a systems programming background:

::: tip CS Fundamentals
This is related to a Computer Science topic that you'll need to be familiar with to understand how Mojo works at a deeper level.
:::

While it aims to be a stepping stone from Python to Mojo, unique Python concepts will be explained along the way, so programmers from all backgrounds can use this to learn Mojo.

## Setup
